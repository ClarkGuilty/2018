\chapter{Conclusions}
We simulated the phase space of a collisional dark matter fluid by implementing a Lattice-Boltzmann method that uses the BGK approximation parameterized by a relaxation time $\tau$ to model the short range interactions. 

We set the relaxation time equivalent to a \emph{thermally averaged cross-section}  $\crosssection$ of $ 3 \e{-26}$ cm$^3$/s, a cosmological matter density of $\Omega_m = 0.312$, and a mass of the dark matter particle of $0.7$ KeV. The origin of these values is discussed in section \ref{metodologiaBGK}. The final value of $\tau$ depends on the units used in the simulation, for the two dimensional phase space simulation the value of $\tau$ is 8972. However, we can test dark matter particle candidates by setting different values for $\crosssection$ and the mass of the particle. 

We successfully implemented a two dimensional phase space simulation in which we tested three initial conditions: Gaussian distribution, Jeans instability, and the collision of two Gaussian distributions. 
The first two were used to test the code, and to reproduce previous work done on collisionless dark matter fluids. 
In the first case the distribution evolved into a rotating spiral, the spatial density kept its Gaussian profile.
In the Jeans instability scenario we had essentially the same behavior, but this time instead of a single Gaussian profile we had three (because of how we initialized the Jeans oscillations).
We observed that our implementation is consistent with previous work and with the expected behavior of the distributions. The third case, the Bullet Cluster-like scenario, showed that there was a periodic movement for the position of the clusters, and the same rotating spiral for the evolution in the phase space of each Gaussian distribution. This was the expected behavior in the absence of a collisional term.

We studied the effects of the collisional term using the Gaussian initial conditions, and Bullet Cluster-like initial conditions. From the first case we concluded that the collisional term reduces the height of the central peak of the spatial density distribution by about 20$\%$, also reduces the velocities on the peak, and increases the density in the tails of the spatial distribution.
From the Bullet Cluster initial conditions we observed that after a collision the new greatest distance of the halos is smaller. After several collision we observed the halos merging, a behavior impossible in a properly implemented no collisional simulation.

We extended the two dimensional simulation to a four dimensional phase space. To test it, we used Gaussian conditions and obtained a complete analog of the two dimensional phase space. We also compared the collisional case with the collisionless one, only to find again that the height of the central peak of the distribution is lower in the collisional case, that there is a higher concentration of mass in the tails of the spatial distribution in the collisional case, and that the velocities in the central peak are lower than in the collisionless scenario.

In the four dimensional simulation we could also observe some problems in due to the low resolution. The arms of the clockwise spiral that the phase space forms are not longer resolvable in the four dimensional simulation after a a few hundred million years. This could be an effect of the lattice noise: due to the low concentrations of mass in the arms of the spirals, the lattice noise is enough to blur them into a simple cloud. 

Finally, we extended the four dimensional simulation into a six dimensional one. The increase in the number of dimensions once again brought a decrease in the resolution. The six dimensional simulation required memory larger than was available on a single computing node. One possible solution is to parallelize the code to be able to use larger amounts of memory.

%Summarizing, we simulated the phase space of a collisional dark matter fluid by implementing several Lattice-Boltzmann simulations with an increasing number of dimensions. The two and the four dimensional simulations were succesfully ran with different scenarios. The six dimensional simulation had very high memory constrains that were beyond the available resources during the development of this work.
