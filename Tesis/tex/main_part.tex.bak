\chapter{The Lattice Boltzmann Algorithm}
\section{General Description}
\label{implementBoltzmann}
Now that we have overviewed the pertinent concepts, we can proceed to the particulars of this implementation. As previously asserted, the heart of the Lattice-Boltzmann Algorithm lies on its discretization of the phase space\cite{franco} \cite{integerLatticeDynamics}.

To discretize the phase space, we must choose the region to simulate. In this work, we name the extremal values in the $w$ axis of the phase space $W_{min}$ and $W_{max}$.
Then, one has to fix either the size of the grid or the size of the lattice.
We name the size of the grid in the $w$ axis $N_w$ (i.e. $N_x$ or $N_{vz}$).
The size of the lattice in the $w$ axis (which we are going to name $dw$) and the extremal values are related by:
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{equation}
dw = \frac{W_{max}-W_{min} }{N_w} 
\end{equation}%\vspace{1mm}
In this work we are going to use the phase-space mass \emph{density}, which means that $\f \dd \vb{r} \dd \vb{v}$ is the density of dark matter whose position is between $\vb{r}$ and $\vb{r} + \dd \vb{r}$, and its velocity is between $\vb{v}$ and $\vb{v} + \dd \vb{v}$.
Now that we have properly defined the phase space grid, we can proceed to initialization.
For simplicity, we developed the simulation using Gaussian initial conditions given by:
\begin{equation}
\f[0]= A \exp{-\frac{\vb{r}^2}{\sigma_r^2} - \frac{\vb{v}^2}{\sigma_v^2}}
\end{equation}
Where $\f[0]$ is the initialization of the phase space density, $A$ is an indirect measure of the total mass in the system, $\vb{r}$ is the vector $(x,y,z)$, $\vb{v}$ is the vector $(vx,vy,vz)$, and $\sigma_i$ are a measure of the width of the Gaussian profile in the given axis. Note that we use a single width for the spatial axes ($\sigma_{\vb{r}}$) and a single width for the velocity axes ($\sigma_{\vb{r}}$). Alternative initialization distributions are going to be considered in the results chapter.

After initialization, the system evolves by the action of the Louville operator and the Collisional operator, nonetheless, the collisions are modeled as instant, which allows to concentrate they entire influence in a collisional step. The schematics of the algorithm can be seen easily in figure  \ref{flowchart}.

    \caption{Flowchat of the algorithm.}
    \label{flowchart}
\end{figure}

Now that we have defined the phase-space, we can obtain the spatial density of matter by integrating the phase space: 
\begin{equation}
\label{defDens0}
\dens[t] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \! \f[t] \, \dd \vb{v}.
\end{equation}
When evaluating in the lattice the integral becomes a sum over the entire velocity lattice:
\begin{equation}
\label{defDens}
\dens[t] = \sum_{\vb{V}_{min}}^{\vb{V}_{max}} \f[t] \, \dd \vb{v}
\end{equation}
and during initialization:
\begin{equation}
\dens[0] = \sum_{\vb{V}_{min}}^{\vb{V}_{max}} \f[0] \, \dd \vb{v}
\end{equation}
Once we have calculated the density, we solve the Poisson equation to obtain the potential due to gravitational interaction:	\cite{integerLatticeDynamics}
\begin{myequation}
\laplacian \pot = 4 \pi G \dens
\end{myequation}
%TODO:a√±adir \\
Where $\pot$ is the gravitational potential and $G$ is the gravitational constant.
To solve the Poisson equation we use the Fourier pseudo-spectral method, which allows for very fast numerical solutions by making use of the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. The idea is simply to apply a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the density, then solve the equation in the Fourier space, and then apply an inverse transform (IFFT). In the Fourier space the Poisson equation is given by\cite{freePoisson} \cite{computerUsingParticles}
\begin{myequation}
\lambda_{\vb{k}}^2 \hat{\Phi}(\vb{k},t) = 4 \pi G \hat{\rho}(\vb{k},t)
\end{myequation}
Where $\hat{g}(\vb{k},t)$ is the Fourier transform of $g(\vb{r},t)$, and $\lambda_{\vb{k}}$ is a constant that depends on the size of the lattice and the wavevector $\vb{k}$.
$\lambda_{\vb{k}}$ is calculated according to the approximation scheme used to solve the equation.
In the the pseudo-spectral approximation, $\lambda_{\vb{k}}$ is given by:
\begin{myequation}
\lambda_{\vb{k}}^2 = \qty(\frac{2 \pi k_x}{X_{max} - X_{min}})^2 + \qty(\frac{2 \pi k_y}{Y_{max} - Y_{min}})^2 + \qty(\frac{2 \pi k_z}{Z_{max} - Z_{min}})^2
\end{myequation}
Therefore, solving the Poisson equation in the Fourier space is reduced to simple arithmetic.
Thanks to the highly efficient implementations of the Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm available nowadays, solving the Poisson equation takes very little time and computational resources.
In this work we use the Fastest Fourier Transform of the West\cite{FFTW} subroutine to handle the Fast Fourier Transforms.

Once we have calculated potential, obtaining the acceleration is straight-forward:
\begin{myequation}
\acce = -\grad \pot
\end{myequation}
Which, in the context of the lattice can be easily calculated with a central difference numerical derivative.

Now, in order to update the phase space, we must first define the time interval to simulate: we name $N_t$ the number of time \emph{instants} to simulate and $\dd t$ the length of each of such instants.
After calculating the acceleration and defining $\dd t$, we can update our phase space.
As mentioned in section \ref{boltz}, the subtlety here is that we will only use integer arithmetic, which means that we do not exactly care about the change in velocity during a time $\dd t$ but for how many cells in the phase space lattice that change represents. This is modeled by:
\begin{equation}
\vb{v}_{n+1} = \vb{v}_n + \toInt{\vb{a}_n \dd t}
\end{equation}%\\%\vspace{5mm}\\
With $\toInt{x}$ representing the operator \tqt{to nearest integer}, so that $\vb{v}$ and $\toInt{\vb{a} \dd t}$ are vectors of integers and $n$ represents the time instant. The update of the velocity is known as \tqt{kick}. Analogously, the update of the position is known as \tqt{drift}, and is given by:
\begin{myequation}
\vb{r}_{n+1} = \vb{r}_n + \toInt{\vb{v}_n \dd t}
\end{myequation}\\
The use of only integer arithmetics allows for the elimination of the rounding error but introduces lattice noise. Regardless, this method creates a one to one map with the continous solution\cite{franco} \cite{integerLatticeDynamics}.\\ \\ 
\vspace{-1mm} The \tqt{kick} and \tqt{drift} together are known as the \tqt{Streaming} step, and it represents the classical movement of particles under a potential but without considering the collision of particles. 
If we want a collisionless simulation, we can just calculate again the density and continue the algorithm from there. If we want a collisional simulation, we must define a collisional step.

\section{The Collisional Step}
\label{metodologiaBGK}
As previously mentioned, solving the collisional integral $C[f]$ is not a straight-forward task, as it depends on the modeling of the short range interactions that we decide to assign to the dark matter particle.
Given that the short range interaction of dark matter is unknown, we avoid using an specific description of the microscopic interactions and choose to use a mesoscopic approach instead, as discussed in section \ref{bgk}. The BGK collisional operator is given by:
\begin{equation}
C[f] = -\frac{1}{\tau}(\f - f_e(\rv))
\end{equation}
Which in the context of the direct integration scheme used in the simulation becomes:
\begin{equation}
f(\vb{r} + \vb{v} \dd t,\vb{v},t) = \f - \frac{\dd t}{\tau}(\f - f_e(\rv))
\end{equation}\\
The idea behind this approach is to recover the macroscopic description of the fluid without committing to a particular microscopic description. In this scenario, the macroscopic effects of the collisions is a local relaxation towards equilibrium, which the BKG operator models using a relaxation time $\tau$ and a local equilibrium distribution $f_e(\rv)$. 

In order to implement a collisional operator we add a collisional step after the streaming step, in which the system performs a relaxation with characteristic (relaxation) time $\tau$ towards the local equilibrium distribution $f_e(\rv)$. 
It is important to notice that the BGK collisional operator is a \emph{scattering} operator and does not consider annihilation or creation of particles. 

After defining the collisional term, we have to choose a distribution function $f_e(\rv)$. We claim that the phase space distribution relaxes towards equilibrium, which means a displacement in the phase space and not the introduction or annihilation of mass.
Therefore, the equilibrium distribution must be perfectly \emph{normalized}  in order to enforce particle number conservation. We normalize this equilibrium distribution by using macroscopic quantities obtained by integrating the velocity part of the phase space.
This macroscopic quantities are: the volumetric density $\dens$, the macroscopic velocity $\vb{u}(\rv)$ and the internal energy $e(\rv)$.

The volumetric density is the same density we have been using so far defined by the integral of equation \ref{defDens0}. The macroscopic velocity $\vb{u}(\rv)$ is defined by the integral:
\begin{equation}
\vb{u}(\rv) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \! \f[t] \, \vb{v}  \dd \vb{v}.
\end{equation}

When evaluating in the lattice the integral becomes:
\begin{equation}
\label{defVel0}
\vb{u} = \sum_{\vb{V}_{min}}^{\vb{V}_{max}} \f[t] \,  \vb{v} \dd \vb{v}
\end{equation}
And the internal energy is defined by the integral:
\begin{equation}
e(\rv) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \! \f[t] \, (\vb{v} -\vb{u})^2 \dd \vb{v}.
\end{equation}
Which also becomes a sum when evaluating in the lattice:
\begin{equation}
\label{defEn0}
e(\rv) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\vb{V}_{min}}^{\vb{V}_{max}} \f[t] \,  (\vb{v} -\vb{u})^2 \dd \vb{v}
\end{equation}\vspace{2mm} 

Note that we are not including explicitly the mass of the dark matter particle in this integrals because it has already been included in the phase space definition.

Now that we have well defined macroscopic variables, we can proceed to choose an equilibrium distribution. Such distribution must obey the next condition:
\begin{equation}
C[f_e] = 0
\end{equation}
Which simply means that if the system is already in local equilibrium, then there is no relaxation. This condition can also be stated as \tqt{the equilibrium function must be a collisional invariant}. In order for $f_e(\rv)$ to be a collisional invariant, it must be build with variables that are also collisional invariant. Fortunately, the macroscopic variables already defined in this chapter are also collisional invariants, and so, we can use them to build equilibrium distributions. The idea behind normalization is to obtain the same macroscopic variables when integrating over $f_e(\rv)$ instead of $\f$.  In this work we use distributions based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution. Alternative equilibrium distributions functions can be considered and may be of interest, but they are beyond the scope of this work. In particular, quantum Maxwellians may be used to include annihilation and creation of particles, and the effects of Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac statistics\cite{2010arXiv1009.3352F}.

The equilibrium function to use is a classical Maxwellian properly normalized for the case of interest:
\begin{equation}
f_e(\rv) = \frac{\rho}{[2 \pi \ e(\rv) ]^{D/2}} \exp[-\frac{(\vb{v}-\vb{u})^2}{2 \ e(\rv)}]
\end{equation}
Where $D$ is the number of spatial dimensions. For example, if the system is a three dimensional dark matter halo, then D will be equal to three.
The Maxwell distribution was originally used to describe the probability distribution of the velocity in a gas under kinetic theory assumptions. Here, we assume collisions as a phenomena that happens instantly. During the time in between, the mechanics of the system are governed by the self-gravitational potential. Therefore, the Maxwell distribution is a good ansatz for the collisional equilibrium distribution function $f_e(\rv)$. \\
Finally, we only need to choose a relaxation time. As in classic kinetic theory, our relaxation time will be given by: %TODO preguntarle a jaime si esto est√° bien.
\begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{1}{n <\sigma v>}
\end{equation}
In terms of the matter density instead of particle number:
\begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{m}{\rho <\sigma v>}
\end{equation}
With $n$ being the mean particle number in the halo, $m$ being the mass of a dark matter particle, $\rho$ being the average density of a dark matter halo and $<\sigma v>$ is the thermally averaged cross-section of the particle.\\
For this simulation we use the average \emph{matter} density of the universe, given by the most recent results of the Planck probe\cite{2018arXiv180706209P}. We are also going to use the value of $<\sigma v>$  constrained by the Bullet Cluster data \cite{2008ApJ6791173R} \cite{2017MNRAS465569R}, and for the dark particle mass we are going to use the lowest mass possible for a fermionic dark matter particle candidate \cite{mariangela}. These values are:
\begin{align}
m &= 0.7 \ \text{KeV} \\
<\sigma v> &= 3 \e{-26} \ \text{cm}^3 / \text{s}\\
\rho = \Omega_m &= 0.312  
\end{align}
The final value of $\tau$ will depend on the particular set of units used in every scenario.

\subsection{Parameters of the simulation}
There are still two important aspects of the simulation to be defined: the units and the boundary conditions.

To set the units we fix the value of one spatial unit ($us$), one unit of time ($ut$), and one unit of mass ($um$) of the simulation, and from there, we proceed to calculate the values of the physical constants in our units.
The physical constant of interest here is the gravitational constant, since it gives the coupling of the gravitational interaction.
We chose units to simulate a dark matter halo of dimensions akin to the Milky Way's dark matter halo. Because of stability conditions, the units may differ between runs, therefore, they are specified at the beginning of each section in the next chapter.

For the boundaries we implement the following conditions:.
\begin{itemize}
\item The boundaries of the spatial axes are periodic. Any portion of mass that leaves the distribution, will re enter through the opposite extreme. This condition assumes the system as periodic.
\item Every portion of mass that leaves the distribution through the velocity axes, will be lost forever. That means that if a particle has a velocity high than the extremal values of the simulation, the particles is no longer considered in the next time step. This condition is not very limiting because we have high extremal values for the velocity and dark matter is traditionally modeled as \emph{cold}.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Results}
For the development of this work we wrote and ran three simulations: a  two dimensional phase space simulation (one spatial and one velocity dimension), a four dimensional phase space simulation, and a six dimensional phase space simulation. 
The first one was develop in order to reproduce the results of Philip Mocz and Sauro Succi published in 2016 \cite{integerLatticeDynamics}, and the results of Sebastian Franco published in 2017 \cite{franco}.
In addition to reproducing results, we also extended the simulation to account for a collisional operator and tested it with different initial conditions.

The four dimensional simulation was develop as a step to develop the six dimensional simulation. Developing a four dimensional simulation allows to implement and test the specifics of increasing dimensionality without much of the visualization problems that arise from a six dimensional simulation. 

The six dimensional simulation is one of the main scopes of this work. The simulation was implemented successfully, however, due to the high RAM memory requirements of the Lattice-Boltzmann method, the resolution is heavily constrained. Even using the HPC cluster avalible at \tqt{Universidad de los Andes}, the resolution of the simulation was too poor to reproduce the results from the other two simulations.

\section{The two dimensional phase space}
%\vspace{-5mm} \vspace{1mm} %descomentar

For the two dimensional simulation we only need two axes, which allows for very high resolution run. We used a squared grid characterized by:
\begin{align}
W_{min} &= -1\\
W_{max} &= 1\\
N_w &= 2048\\
dw &= 1/1024
\end{align}
As mentioned in section \ref{implementBoltzmann}, $W$ represents the axis (in this case $r$ or $v$), $N_w$ represents the size of the grid in the $w$ axis, $dw$ represents the size of a lattice unit in the $w$ axis and $-1$ and $1$ are the extremal values of the phase space in the $w$ axis.
We always use grid sizes of the form $N_w = 2^n$ with $n$ positive integer, because the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm performs better and faster when calculating discrete transforms of sizes $2^n \ 3^m \ 5^l$ for n,m,l positive integers.%\\ \\ 
%\vspace{-1mm}

In this section we are going to use three initial conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Gaussian density profile used to test the code and introduce the behavior of the phase space density over time.
\item A Jeans instability test, in which we reproduce the spatial conditions for a periodic jeans oscillation and use a Gaussian profile for the velocity distribution. These conditions are used to reproduce the previous work aforementioned. 
\item A Bullet Cluster-like initial conditions, in which we have two Gaussian profiles (each one with its own variance and amplitude) separated by a given distance. One of the main scopes of this work is to analyze the Bullet Cluster-like system and compare the phase space evolution of the collisional case with its collisionless counterpart.
%Additionally, we are going to reproduce the behavior of the collisional baryonic gas.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{No collisional case}
We begin with the Gaussian conditions because their simplicity and ease to analyze makes them the best introductory example.
The initialization of the phase space can be seen in figure \ref{1dInit}, along with its correspondent spatial density.
After initialization we proceed to calculate the potential and the acceleration, which can be seen in figure \ref{1dInit2}.
The values used to initialize the phase space were:
\begin{align}
\sigma_r &= 0.2 \ \text{us} \\
\sigma_v &= 0.2 \ \text{us} / \text{ut} \\
A &= 50  \ \text{um}
\end{align} %TODO actualizar valores de simulacion, incluida masa total
Which yields a total mass of $1.26\e{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, a value in accordance with recent estimates of the total mass of our galaxy's dark matter halo \cite{2013JCAP07016N}. %TODO colocar la verdadera masa y unidades.

    \label{1dInit2}
\end{figure}

To test the simulation we reproduce previous work in the collisionless case.
To do so we run the simulation and check upon the behavior of the phase space density, the spatial density, the potential and the acceleration.
In the phase space grid, we expect the cells with positive velocity to move to the right side of the plot, but, as they move to the right they are also being attracted towards the left because of the symmetry of the initial conditions. Therefore, the cells with positive velocity will move towards the inferior-right side of the plot, while cells with negative velocity will move towards the upper left side of the phase space.

    \label{1dphase}
\end{figure}


This behavior is in complete accordance with previous work and can be seen in figure \ref{1dphase}, where we plot different time instants chosen to display the clock-wise spiral of the phase space evolution.

To visualize the linear density, we plot the linear density vs position. We observe an initial increase in the height of the central peak and then little bumps trying to abandon the central distribution as they are gravitationally pulled back before crossing the spatial of the lattice boundaries. This behavior can be seen in figure \ref{1dDens}

The images are from 31, 114, 300 and 920 million years after initialization.  }
    \label{1dDens}
\end{figure}

In addition to Gaussian initial conditions, we reproduced the Jeans instability, which was also tested in previous work. In this scenario, the Jeans instability is given by:
\begin{equation}
f(r,v,0) = \frac{\bar{\rho}}{(2 \pi \sigma^2)^{1/2}} \exp(-\frac{v^2}{2 \sigma^2}) (1 + A \cos(kr))
\end{equation}\\
\vspace{-1mm}Such that $\rho$ is the average phase density of the system, $\sigma$ is a measure of the width of the velocity Gaussian profile, $A$ is the amplitude of the density fluctuation and $k$ is the wavenumber of the density fluctuation. We used the following values:
\begin{align}
\bar{\rho} &= 10 \  \text{um} \ \text{us}^{-1} \ (\text{us/ut})^{-1} \\
\sigma &= 0.1 \ \text{us/ut} \\
A &= 0.9999 \\
k &= 2 \pi \ \text{us}^{-1}
\end{align}
For which the phase space behaved like three successive Gaussian profiles, that is because we met the Jeans instability criteria. Otherwise, the distributions would have collapsed to form just one big halo. This result were also compatible with previous work published on one dimensional collisionless dark matter fluids. The evolution of the Jeans instability phase space can be seen in figure \ref{1dJeans}

    \label{1dJeans}
\end{figure}

The last set of initial conditions is the Bullet Cluster-like scenario, in which two Gaussian distributions of mass collide due to their gravitational interaction.
Each Gaussian has its own variance and amplitude. In the bullet cluster scenario we had that one of the clusters was heavier, therefore, we also fix one cluster heavier than the other.

The initial conditions are given by the distribution:
\begin{equation}
\f[0] = A_1\exp{-\frac{(x-0.4)^2}{2 \sigma_1^2} - \frac{v^2}{2 \sigma_v^2}} + A_2\exp{-\frac{(x+0.4)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} - \frac{v^2}{2 \sigma_v^2}}
\end{equation}
Such that $A_i$ is a measure of the total mass of the ith halo, $\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of the Gaussian profile of the halo in the spatial axis, and $\sigma_v^2$ is the variance of the Gaussian profile in the velocity axis. The values used to initialize the simulation were:
\begin{align}
\sigma_1 &= 0.04 \ \text{us} \\
\sigma_2 &= 0.04  \ \text{us} \\
\sigma_v &= 0.06 \ \text{us} \\
A_1 &= 40 \ \text{um} \\
A_2 &= 30  \ \text{um}
\end{align}
Given the collisionless nature of this run, we expect the halos to simply pass through each other \emph{without any loss of energy} due to the collision. In other words, the \emph{density} profiles will have a periodic movement and will eventually return to their initial location.
In the phase space we see that each halo forms the clockwise spiral from the Gaussian initial conditions. In addition to that, we can see how when the halos occupy the same spatial position, they have very different velocities, which keeps them decoupled. The evolution of the phase space can be seen in figure \ref{phaseNoColBullet}. The oscillations in the spatial density can be seen in figure \ref{densNoColBullet}

\subsection{The collisional case}
Now, for the collisional case we are going to implement the Gaussian initial conditions as an introductory example, and then use the insight to interpret more easily the Bullet Cluster like case.
Recalling the discussion on choosing a $\tau$ (see \ref{metodologiaBGK}), the final value was unit dependent. The value of $\tau$ in the units used in this section is $$\tau =8972 \ \text{ut}$$ Once again, we start with the Gaussian initial conditions.
We ran the simulation with exactly the same initial conditions as in the no collisional case and observed the evolution of the phase space.
The value of $\tau$ implies a very small collisional term.
Therefore, if we looked at the phase space distribution of the collisional case in the same way as we did in the last section, we would not be able to spot any difference between the two cases. Instead of plotting the phase space of the collisional case, we choose plot the percentual difference between the cases: %TODO depronto haya que cambiar todos los porcentual a percentage 
\begin{equation}
\label{Zeta}
Z = 100\qty(\frac{f_{\tau}(\rv,t) - f_0(\rv,t)}{f_0(\rv,t)})
\end{equation}
With $Z$ being the percentual difference of the collisional case with the collisionless case. This representation will allow us to interpret more easily the effects of the collisional term in the distribution.

The evolution of the percentual difference in the phase space between the two cases can be seen in figure \ref{phaseColGauss}. In it we can appreciate  two main regions: a blue region (dominated by collisionless dark matter), and a red region (dominated by collisional dark matter). The collisionless fluid has higher velocities in the centre of the spatial distribution (the blue region), but the collisional distribution has a higher density in the tails of the Gaussian, implying a lower central density peak. This lower central peak in the spatial density can be observed directly in figure \ref{densColGauss}, where values higher than zero correspond to higher collisional density, and lower than zero to a higher collisionless density. Now it is easy to see that the collisional peak is about 20 percent lower than its collisionless counterpart and remains that way, even after a very long time.

    \label{densColGauss}
\end{figure}

Recapitulating, due to the collisional term we have two main effects:
\begin{itemize}
\item There is a considerable reduction of velocity in the central part of the distribution.
\item There is an increment in the spatial density outside of the central region. Additionally, these regions have slightly higher velocity than their collisionless counterpart.
\end{itemize}

Now that we have introduced the collisional effects with the Gaussian example, we can proceed to the real case of interest: the Bullet Cluster-like scenario. 

Recalling from \ref{bulletExplain}, Galaxy Clusters have three main components: a highly collisional baryonic gas, a collisionless distribution of galaxies, and a slightly collisional dark matter gas. Here, we are going to simulate the slightly collisional dark matter component and compare it with the collisionless case.% In addition to that, we are also going qualitatively the hot baryonic gas as a very collisional fluid. %TODO si queda tiempo hacer un ap√©ndice con TAU = 50

For this run we use the same simulation parameters as those of the no collisional case.
In the collisionless run the halos had a periodic movement, that was because there was no dissipation of energy.
Now that we include short range interactions, there is a loss of energy every time the halos collide (in addition to the loss of energy due to the internal evolution of each collisional Gaussian halo), and because of that, the halos will not return to their initial state. How long will it take for the halos to permanently merge is directly related to the relaxation time. Our relaxation time (8972 ut) is quite high, which is why we expect them to merge only after several collisions.

In figure \ref{phaseColBullet} we plot the phase space during the aphelion of the halos, expecting the distance between them to become smaller as time passes by. It is easy to appreciate that the system is permanently loosing energy and was bound to collapse.
After six collisions, the smaller halo becomes a current in the bigger one forming a single final halo.
This is a very different behavior from the collisionless case, in which the halos could oscillate forever.
In figure \ref{densColBullet} we plot the spatial density at the same time instants as in figure \ref{phaseColBullet}. It is clear that the halos are getting closer and will eventually merge. Notice that in the final frame, even though the halos have merged, the smaller halo is mostly around the heavier one and will fall inwards given enough time.

Finally, we close the two dimensional results comparing the phase space evolution of the collisional case with its no collisional counterpart.
We plot the percentage difference $Z$ as defined for the Gaussian case in figure \ref{colBulletPhase}.
The first frame shows the distributions at their first aphelion, here the two distributions are not too different but the halos of the collisional case are closer together.
In the second frame we observe the collisional distribution on its second aphelion, but the collisionless distribution (blue) has barely moved. The third frame is during the second aphelion of the no collisional distribution, and shows that the collisional halos are already collapsing into one heavier halo.
The last frame shows the third aphelion of the no collisional case, here, the smaller halo of the collisional distribution has collapsed into a current in the bigger halo.
In the figure we can appreciate that after the first collision, the collisional distribution is the first one to collide again. The reduction on the oscillation period is an expected effect of the dissipation of energy due to the short range interactions..

%TODO arreglar aphelio.
%Now, for the hot baryonic gas we choose a relaxation time that mirrors its highly collisional nature. 
%This relaxation time is not linked to any particular investigation, as it only serves our interest of testing the simulation when the fluid is highly collisional (highly in astrophysical standards). The relaxation time chosen is $$\tau = 50 \ \text{ut}$$

%This time we plot both the collisional phase space, and the percentage difference. Given our rather low relaxation time, we expect the distribution to lost a considerable amount of energy each collision. The system quickly collapses into one agglomeration of mass.

\section{Four dimensional phase space}
In the case of the four dimensional phase space we need four axes to describe the phase space. This increase in the number of axes in regards to the two dimensional case means that we are going to have to sacrifice a lot of resolution in order to comply to RAM memory constrains. The four dimensional grid used is characterized by:
\begin{align}
W_{min} &= -1\\
W_{max} &= 1\\
N_w &= 128\\
dw &= 1/64
\end{align}
Likewise, the of units to use are:
\begin{align}
1\ us &= 50\ \text{kpc}\\
1\ ut &= 0.003 \ \text{t}_0\\
1\ um &= 10^{11} \ \text{M}_{\astrosun}
\end{align}
With t$_0$ being the age of the universe today, \text{M}$_{\astrosun}$ being a solar mass and a kiloparsec (kpc) is equal to $3.0857\e{19}$ m. In this units, the gravitational constant has a value of:
\begin{equation}
G = 0.006141 \ (1 \ us)^3 \ (1 \ um)^{-1} \ (1 \ ut)^{-2}
\end{equation}
\subsection{No collisional case}
The four dimensional case is initialized using a Gaussian distribution. The main interest in the Gaussian case is to test the simulation and calibrate the stability requirements based on certain simulation parameters. 

The four dimensional phase space is initialized using the following parameters:
\begin{align}
\sigma_r &= 0.2 \ \text{us} \\
\sigma_v &= 0.2 \ \text{us} / \text{ut} \\
A &= 50  \ \text{um}
\end{align}

Which yields a total mass of $7.8 \ M_{\odot} \e{10}$, a value similar to the mass of the Triangulum Galaxy (M 33) \cite{2003MNRAS342199C}.

The initialization of the Gaussian conditions can be seen in figure \ref{2dInit}. Here we plot a 2D cut of the four dimensional phase space. We take the cut $f(x,y=0,vx,vy=0)$ because is a direct analog of the phase space we saw in last section. We also plot the potential of the system, and the spatial density along with the correspondent acceleration vector field.


\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    %\includegraphics[width=10cm,height =7cm]{Diapositiva1.jpg}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.42]{imag/2dInitPhase.png}

    \caption{Upper left: the cut $f(x,y=0,vx,vy=0)$ at $t=0$ of the phase space. It is equivalent to the initial Gaussian conditions from last section. Upper right: the potential due initial conditions, it is a bidimensional version of the potential of last section. Bottom: the density from initialization along with the acceleration vector field (white arrows). Initially the system is accelerating towards its centre. }
    \label{2dInit}
\end{figure}

Let's consider first the two dimensional spatial density. The distribution initially collapses very quickly and then emits little matter of bumps. However, once again, the bumps are gravitationally pulled back before leaving the boundaries of the simulation. This behavior is completely equivalent to the one dimensional spatial density from last section. The spatial density can be observed in figure \ref{2dDens}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    %\includegraphics[width=10cm,height =7cm]{Diapositiva1.jpg}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{imag/2dDens3.png}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{imag/2dDens40.png}
    \caption{Upper left: density at t = 1.5 ut, the instant of the initial collapse, note that this frame has a higher color scale. Upper right: density it t=3.5 ut, here we observe the first bump of matter being expelled from the halo. Bottom left: now the spatial density multiple bumps of matter, these bumps are being gravitationally pulled back and lose intensity as they propagate. Bottom right: the bumps are now invisible at this color scale but the distribution is still bumpy. }
    \label{2dDens}
\end{figure}



To analyze the phase space we plot a two dimensional cut of the phase space. In figure \ref{2dPhase} we can see the evolution of the cut of the phase space. Once again, we see the phase space forming a clockwise spiral. Nonetheless, due to the low resolution, the arms are not well defined after a long time, this is the same effect the makes the density bumps invisible in figure \ref{2dDens}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    %\includegraphics[width=10cm,height =7cm]{Diapositiva1.jpg}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{imag/2dPhase3.png}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{imag/2dPhase7.png}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{imag/2dPhase18.png}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{imag/2dPhase40.png}
    \caption{Upper left: phase space at t = 1.5, here the phase space is starting to form its caracteristic clockwise rotating spiral. Upper right. The system keeps evolving into the spiral, note that there are no regions behaving as a single pixel. Bottom left: after a while the distribution forms the arms which characterize the bumps seen in figure \ref{2dDens}. Bottom right: due the low resolution, the arm structure can no longer be distinguished.  }
    \label{2dPhase}
\end{figure}

Due to the discretization, we must be careful when choosing the size of the time step ($dt$). If we choose it too small, it will be shorter than the time the \emph{information} needs to propagate in the lattice. When this happens, we will see sections of the phase space completely frozen in time until information has had enough time to propagate. If we choose a time step too big, the time integration will diverge from the real solution because of the direct integration scheme used. The effect of a poorly chosen time step can be appreciated in figure \ref{2dBadTime}, where we have chosen the time step to be $0.1$ ut, that is one forth of its previous value. In order to guarantee that the time step is big enough, it should be bigger than $\frac{1}{3} \dv{x}{v}$.

    \caption{The evolution of the phase space when the time step is poorly chosen. The phase space is divided in regions that only update every few time steps.

Bottom left: the regions have changed internally, nonetheless the interface of the regions has a lasting influence on the distribution. Bottom right: the phase space spiral. This solution of the phase space is inaccurate because of the error introduced by the pixeling of the distribution.}
    \label{2dBadTime}
\end{figure}

\section{The collisional case}

For the collisional case of the four dimensional phase space we are going keep using the Gaussian conditions. The value of $\tau$ in the units used in this section is: $$\tau = 11963$$ ut. As in the collisional case from last section, we do not plot the evolution of the cut $f(x,0,vx,0)$ of the velocity space, but the percentage difference $Z$ as define in equation \ref{zeta}

The effect of the collisional term in the phase space is quite similar to the two dimensional case (that's not a surprise given since the central cut of the phase space is an analog of the two dimensional phase space)









\newpage
\section{Six dimensional phase space}
In the case of the six dimensional phase space we need six axes to model the phase space. This increase in the number of axes implies an even lower resolution than in the four dimensional case. The six dimensional grid is characterized by the following parameters:
\begin{align}
W_{min} &= -1\\
W_{max} &= 1\\
N_w &= 32\\
dw &= 1/16
\end{align}
and the of units to use are:
\begin{align}
1\ us &= 35\ \text{kpc}\\
1\ ut &= 0.004 \ \text{t}_0\\
1\ um &= 10^{11} \ \text{M}_{\astrosun}
\end{align}
With t$_0$ being the age of the universe today, \text{M}$_{\astrosun}$ being a solar mass and a kiloparsec (kpc) is equal to $3.0857\e{19}$ m. In this units, the gravitational constant has a value of:
\begin{equation}
G = 0.031830 \ (1 \ us)^3 \ (1 \ um)^{-1} \ (1 \ ut)^{-2}
\end{equation}
This low resolution carries along heavy visualization problems along with a very high lattice noise. With such low resolution, we can not claim that the simulation is indeed recovering the continuum Boltzmann equation. More optimization is need
