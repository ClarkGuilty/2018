Galaxy clusters have three main constituents: dark matter, intracluster gas (which is almost in its entirety ionised hydrogen and helium), and the galaxy themselves. \\ citar http://staff.on.br/etelles/lectures/Galaxies_in_the_Universe__An_Introduction.pdf

We can observe the galaxies already in the visual and infrared band. We know of the existence of dark matter in clusters thanks to the work of Fritz Zwicky and posterior work in the missing mass problem in galaxy clusters. We can observe the incracluster baryonic matter in the x-ray band thanks to the Bremsstrahlung radiation
